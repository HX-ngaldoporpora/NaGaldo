### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Na, a full-stack developer passionate about planning and following the entire workflow and logics behind each project. In fact, I found myself very comfortable in charge of the code integration process in my last work as I applied my abilities as a problem solver. I also love modeling and coding the front-end structure in order to achieve the best possible UX and I hope to keep growing in this area.

I am very organized and efficient, which means I can successfully meet deadlines and expectations. I am always willing to grow and improve, by learning new technologies or exchanging experiences with my peers.
 
In the last few years, I have traveled around Latin America, living in different countries, learning about their culture and being fascinated by their amazing landscapes. 

Now, after graduating from Henry's Bootcamp and my experience as a Teaching Assistant, I feel completely ready to take my first steps in the IT world as a full-stack developer.
