### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


What about me? ... In fact, I find myself being fascinated by the infinite connections of workflow in coding as I finish a Bootcamp to be a full-stack developer in Henry, after many years traveling and living in different places of Latin America, being blown away by its landscapes and the infinite connections of nature. 
My aim is to become a digital nomad as I bring together my passion for coding and traveling. Till then, I enjoy the challenges of having become a teaching assistant, while I finish my last project before graduation.

How to contact me? Easy.. nataliagaldoporpora82@gmail.com 

Have a nice code!
